Hello, {{ $company->website->company }}

<p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">

<h3 style="font-weight:bold; margin: 0; color: #0077ff">Starting Guide Steps & Instructions</h3>

<p style="background: rgb(240,240,240)">Login using the email and password provided when registering. If you forgot simply click the "forgot password" and provide the email that was used to register.</p>

<ol style="font-weight: bold; line-spacing: 1.25; font-size: 1rem;">
    <li>When first logged in to TRAXIT you will be presented a "Start Guide", with the first step being to provide account details. Now you may notice that it is a little redundant to registering however we do this to make sure that we are getting a specific type of user and apologize for this inconveniance. This guide is intened to help you get started. The next steps listed are to work in conjuction with the getting started guide.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Attached to this email you will find an example spread sheet which you can use to properly format a list of contacts/clients you would like to upload. Now this is not required and you do have the option to input manually however uploading is the faster option. If you choose to use this spread sheet make sure that you follow the format provided and prior to uploading remove the row that contains the headers of each column. If you do not do this you will get an error.</li>
    <br>
    <li>After you have a contact or a list of contacts entered the next step is building your first workflow. Now this is completely customizable and can be set up however you would like. We recommend the first status in your workflow being "Received" and the last status being "Complete". Anything inbetween can be "Data Entry" to "Awaiting Payments" etc.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Once you have completed the above or have decided to skip the setup guide you will be given the option to "Start TRAXIT". This will conclude the setup guide and you will not be presented with it again after that point.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Next step if you completed the setup guide is to start your first engagement. Engagements are essentially the jobs you intend to track with your workflow. So for example, if you have built a workflow to track your 1040 tax returns, you would most likely want to use the "Tax Return" engagement type for you first engagement. At this time you will also have to assign the engagement to a user/team member. Now if you don't want to assign the engagement to your self and have a team member in mind simply head over to the "Admin" view and under team members add the new user.</li>
    <br>
    <li>At this point you should be able to navigate to your dashboard where it should being showing you data visualization of your firm. The goal of the dashboard is to give you 10,000 ft view of what is happening and as you add engagements this feature will make more sense and potentially become more useful when making decisions.</li>
</ol>
